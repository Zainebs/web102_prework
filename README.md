Games is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

7 Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [Yes ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ yes] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [yes ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding

The following **optional** features are implemented:
changed the css

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [ ] The app  isn't very functional currently. A search bar would be a great way to make the website more functional however, I do not know how to implement one as of yet.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

## Notes

Some challenges I faced were working with the ternary operator and trying to translate the code. I honestly was unfamiliar with a lot of the topics covered in the prework, however, found it quite interesting to learn. I still don't fully understand how to implement the filter, reduce, and arrow function without continuously looking back at the documentation but, hopefully before the program, I will gain a better understanding.
